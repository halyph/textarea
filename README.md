# [textarea.my](https://textarea.my)

## What is this madness?

A minimalist text editor that lives entirely in your browser and stores everything in the URL hash. Yes, you read that
right. Your entire novel is now part of the address bar. Good luck sharing that link!

## Features (aka things that make this ridiculous)

- 📝 **It's a textarea!** Actually not.
- 🗜️ **Compression magic** - Your text gets compressed with deflate because we're fancy like that
- 🔗 **URL storage** - Share your notes by copying a 500-character URL. Your friends will love it!
- 🌓 **Dark mode** - Respects your poor eyes and your color scheme preference
- 💾 **Auto-save** - Debounced to 500ms because we're not savages
- 📱 **Mobile friendly** - Type your manifesto on the go
- 🎯 **No backend** - Zero servers were harmed in the making of this app

## How to use

1. Open [textarea.my](https://textarea.my)
2. Type stuff
3. Marvel at the URL getting longer
4. Try to share it
5. ...
6. Profit

## Pro tips

- Start your document with `# Title` to set a custom page title
- Your data lives in localStorage AND the URL. Double the fun!
